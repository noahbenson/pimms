    `osfpath(p)` creates and returns an `OSFPath` object, which is a type of

    an `OSFPath`, then it is returned as-is. Otherwise `str(p)` is converted

    `osfpath(p, a1, a2...)` converts `p` into an `OSFPath` then joins the `a1`,
    `a2`, etc. values to the end of the path and returns the joined path.

    OSF paths take the format `'osf://<project-ID>:<storage>/<path>'` where the
    storage is optional (defaulting to `'osfstorage'`) and an empty path refers
    to the project storage's root. The project-ID is the code used to find the
    project online. For example, the webpage reached at the website
    `https://osf.io/tery8/` is the project page for the project whose ID is
    `tery8`.

    If any of the optional keyword arguments are given, then the returned path
    will always use the specified options; a new path is returned with updated
    options if necessary; this is done before joining paths if multiple
    positional arguments are given. If the `client` keyword is given, then it is
    modified by the keyword options before being used in the path. All optional
    keyword arguments have a default value of `Ellipsis`, which indicates that
    the `client`'s value for that option should be used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : path-like
        The path or path-like object to convert into an OSFPath, typically a
        string.
    client : OSFClient or None, optional
        The `OSFClient` object to use. The `OSFClient` is responsible primarily
        for the caching of data locally. If `OSFClient` is `None`, then an
        `OSFClient` object is created for the project using a temporary cache
        directory.
    cache_path : path-like or None, optional
        The local directory in which cache files should be stored. This option
        is ignored if `client` is not `None`; otherwise it is passed to the
        created client object. The cache directory is the root cache directory
        for the entire OSF project.
    file_cache_mode : cloudpathlib.enums.FileCacheMode, optional
        How often to clear the file cache; see [cloudpathlib's caching
        docs](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/caching/) for more
        information about the options in `cloudpathlib.enums.FileCacheMode`.
    mkdir_mode : int, optional
        The mode to use when making directories in the cache. By default this is
        `0o775`. This option is ignored if the `client` option is not `None`.
    pagesize : int, optional
        The number of items to include in a single page when paging directory
        contents from the OSF server. The default is 100. This option is ignored
        if the `client` option is not `None`.
